So this is the project. Look nowhere else.

== Description

* This one currently has one very basic end-to-end test for a very specific functionality. There are few blank tests.

* Used NPM build tool along with Javascript.

== Running the tests

* Very simple, since the environment I used to make the test was Staging, simply `npm run run:staging` would run all the tests

* If you don't believe what your console says and want to Open Cypress and see it for your eyes then `npm run run:staging`

* Off course if you want to run the test in Test environment then change `staging` to `test` and fail miserably as I have the username and password hardcoded.
